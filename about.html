      <h2>Why The Bachelors of Science in Biology?</h2>
      <p>
        I was previously a pre-med student and have actually had extensive experience in the medical field. I was registered with 
        the Oregon Board of Nursing as a Certified Nursing Assistant shortly after graduating highschool. I then went and got my 
        B.S in Biology with a Minor in Chemistry. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and began teaching at the OSU Cadaver Lab for a year.
        After my year at the lab I scribed for a year and a half before applying to medical school. Before submitting my application,
        I decided to switch careers due to irreconcilliable moral differences with the field. Medicine is amazing, the profession is 
        full of wonderful people, unfortunately it just wasn't for me.

      <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>
          From a young age I had alot of exposure to technology from my parents. I got my first email at the age of 8, a hotmail. My parents both encouraged 
          technological literacy as they were both computer engineers at intel.
          I have always been interested in not only how computers function, but the science of computing and solving complex or interesting problems.
          I made a very difficult decision to study Biology over Computer Science when first entering college. For better or for worse, I am now returning
          to a familiar passion and starting a career in computer science!
