            <article><h1>Project Day 3 - Data Pipeline Fault Post Mortem</h1>
            
                <p>
                    Unfortunately a major oversight of mine was the lack of stratification within the EventParticipation field.
                    I orginally assumed that it was a byproduct of the manufactured nature of the data but had failed to consider 
                    if it was actually due to an error in my data pipeline. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of preventative measures to prevent this that I would likely have applied to a live pipeline in a 
                    containerized application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the static nature of my pipeline being a CRM from a CSV I designed the functions to parse data, convert to pandas dataframe,
                    and validate for type. This meant that I had no form of reporting or monitoring live data because data was not live. I overlooked the possiblility
                    of improperly handled data since the high usability score on kaggle showing that the data were very polished had given me a false sense of confidence.
                </p>
                <h3>What went wrong</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the fields was a boolean value, except it wasn't.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When handling the above column I accidentally automatically converted it to a boolean value in my mind when it was actually represented as a python string object.
                    This has a unique property when met with the .astype(bool) since python will interpret the value as existing and then replace every value with true.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Correct</strong>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/dfPartCorrect.png"></li>
                    <strong>incorrect</strong>
                    <li><img src="../../assets/images/dfPartincorrect.png"></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Fortunately I had already learned many things from this experience. Besides validating that data are correctly converted from source, I also learned many data analysis methods.
                    This insight can continue to guide my understanding as the univariate analysis of all other fields is still accurate. I have already performed recalculations of bivariate analyses
                    and kmeans analyses. I will likely proceed by permuting combinations of kmeans and features to optimize for the four metrics: Inertia, Silhouette Score, CH Index, DBI, and then 
                    iterating on model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow I look forwards to finalizing the features I will initially iterate with and developing either a discriminative two model architecture to analyze churn prediction or by 
                    meta modeling and iterating on features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may be undervaluing performance as a determinant for how I train my model. Explainability of features is only valuable insofar as they provide accurate predictions. 
                    In the abscense of exceptionally clear explainable features I need to trust more in the statistics. I will proceed with a looser criteria for explainability and instead
                    defensively monitor unexplainable predictive features instead of proactively excluding them from my design. I still think that it is important to exclude very obviously unrelated
                    fields such as name, contant information, donorID.
