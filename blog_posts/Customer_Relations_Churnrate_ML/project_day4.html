                    I took a little vacation to go to a wedding, my friend got married in Michigan so I took a bit of a break.
                    With renewed vigor I decided to consult the great world wide web for some insight on how to continue with my analysis.
                    Using the scatter plot as I have been with my grouped features and clustering the scaled features seemed to be very slow. 
                    Doing this for 50 states and 2-13 clusters is very time consuming when analyzing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went a step back and used a script to automate the kmeans clustering and created a scaled metric to evaluate
                    the best clustering. This assumes my features are roughly linear which is a bold assumption. I think there is still room for exploring
                    bands of donors, such as seperating donors who donate more than 5000 from those who donate less than 5000. 
                </p>

                    For now I want to proceed with a quick decision so I can get a prototype rolling. I decided to use principal component analysis
                    to reduce the amount of dimensions in my data. Using a T-SNE plot over all 50 states, I realize now that there is a very clear seperation between certain data.
                    I previously excluded using clustering of k = 2 which I now realize is a mistake. My clustering script also had a drawback of being 
                    biased towards higher clustering counts. I adjusted the script such that it only performs kmeans on PCA'd data from k=2 clusters to k=8 clusters.
                    This gave much better clustering data and I am more confident that these PCA'd features actually result from measurable donor features rather than numerical artifacts.
