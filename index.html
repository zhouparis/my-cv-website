      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>I'm a software developer who graduated from Oregon State University with Bachelors in Computer Science recently.
        I was previously a pre-med student and have actually had extensive Experience in the medical field. I was registered with 
        the Oregon Board of Nursing as a Certified Nursing Assistant shortly after graduating highschool. I then went and got my 
        B.S in Biology with a Minor in Chemistry. I graduated Summa Cum Laude and began teaching at the OSU Cadaver Lab for a year.
        After my year at the lab I scribed for a year and a half before applying to medical school. Before submitting my application,
        I decided to switch careers due to irreconcilliable moral differences with the field. Medicine is amazing, the profession is 
        full of wonderful people, unfortunately it just wasn't for me. I stuck with it for such a long time and committed so much to it
        I thought I had to apply.
